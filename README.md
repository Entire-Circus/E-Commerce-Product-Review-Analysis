## Project Intent

This project combines analytical depth with practical presentation. While the full technical report details the complete workflow â€” including data preparation, exploratory analysis, natural language processing, and predictive modeling â€” the accompanying dashboard offers a **concise, interactive overview** of the key insights and results.

The dashboard is intended as the primary touchpoint for reviewing outcomes and exploring patterns, while the report provides a deeper look into the underlying methods and decisions supporting the analysis.
