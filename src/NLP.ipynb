      "1. I love this style and wanted to keep them so badly but bc they are so narrow, if you adjust the strap you can see the Velcro and it loses its entire look. I returned them to the store to see if sizing up would help, but same issue. I don’t have a wide foot so I’m not sure who these fit.\n",

      "4. These did not fit my feet width. They seemed more for folks who have thinner/slender feet. They are beautiful though.\n",
      "5. These shoes are fantastic! They fit great, are easy to walk in, feel great, and are SO cute. I love that the strap hold my foot in place and they form to your feet after a few wears. They fit my feet quite snugly so I imagine these shoes would not fit well on wider feet.\n",
